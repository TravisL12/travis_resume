            <p>My experience as a developer has had me learning at least one new technology per year.
              Ruby was my initial language of choice
              and as I was becoming proficient in Rails I soon found myself on a project using AngularJS. While I
              delved deeper into Angular and single page applications I found myself on a project using PHP and MySQL.
              Currently I am involved in projects using React + Typescript and writing test coverage with Jest and
              Enzyme.
            </p>
            <p>The rotation of languages and technologies year over year is part of the job, and I'm
              comfortable
              knowing that there will be more to come in the years ahead.
